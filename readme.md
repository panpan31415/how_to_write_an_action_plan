## The Easy Guide to Developing an Effective Action Plan

## What is an Action Plan?

- An action plan is a checklist for the steps or tasks
  you need to complete in order to achieve the goals you have set.

## Components of an action plan include

- A well-defined description of the goal to be achieved
- Tasks/steps that need to be carried out to reach the goal
- People who will be in charge of carrying out each task
- When will these tasks be completed (deadlines and milestones)
- Resources needed to complete the tasks
- Measures to evaluate progress

> An action plan is not something set in stone. As your organization grows,
> and surrounding circumstances change, you will have to revisit and make
> adjustments to meet the latest needs.

> Sometimes businesses don’t spend much time on developing an action plan before
> an initiative, which, in most cases, leads to failure. If you haven’t heard,
> “failing to plan is planning to fail” said Benjamin Franklin supposedly once.

## How to Write an Action Plan | Best Practices

### Step 1: Define your end goal

Planning a new initiative?
Start by defining where you are and where you want to be.

Solving a problem?
Analyze the situation and explore possible solutions before prioritizing them.

Then write down your goal.
Before you move on to the next step, run your goal through the SMART criteria.
Or in other words, make sure that it is

- Specific – well-defined and clear
- Measurable – include measurable indicators to track progress
- Attainable – realistic and achievable within the resources, time, money,
  experience, etc. you have
- Relevant – align with your other goals
- Timely – has a finishing date

use a SMART goals worksheet to simplify this process.

| Title             | SMART Goal Worksheet |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Name              |                      |
| Date              |                      |
| Goal in mind      | Add text             |
| Is it specific?   | Add text             |
| Is it measurable? | Add text             |
| Is it attainable? | Add text             |
| Is it relevant?   | Add text             |
| Is it timely      | Add text             |
| SMART GOAL        | Add text             |

### Step 2: List down the steps to be followed

The goal is clear. What exactly should you do to realize it?

Create a rough template to list down all the tasks to be performed, due dates
and people responsible.

| task title | assigned to | due date |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| -          | -           | -        |
| -          | -           | -        |
| -          | -           | -        |
| -          | -           | -        |
| -          | -           | -        |

### Step 3: Prioritize tasks and add deadlines

It’s time to reorganize the list by prioritizing the tasks. Some steps, you may
need to prioritize as they can be blocking other sub-steps.

Add deadlines, and make sure that they are realistic. Consult with the person
responsible for carrying it out to understand his or her capacity before
deciding on deadlines.

### Step 4: Set Milestones

Milestones can be considered mini goals leading up to the main goal at the end.
The advantage of adding milestones is that they give the team members to look
forward to something and help them stay motivated even though the final due
date is far away.

Start from the end goal and work your way back as you set milestones. Remember
not to keep too little or too much time in between the milestone you set. It’s
a best practice to space milestones two weeks apart.

### Step 5: Identify the resources needed

Before you start your project, it’s crucial to ensure that you have all the
necessary resources at hand to complete the tasks. And if they are not currently
available, you need to first make a plan to acquire them.

This should also include your budget. You can assign a column of your action
plan to mark the cost of each task if there are any.

### Step 6: Visualize your action plan

The point of this step is to create something that everyone can understand at a
glance and that can be shared with everyone.

Whether your action plan comes in the shape of a flowchart, Gantt chart, or
table, make sure that it clearly communicates the elements we have identified
so far – tasks, task owners, deadlines, resources, etc.

This document should be easily accessible to everyone and should be editable

### Step 7: Monitor, evaluate and update

Allocate some time to evaluate the progress you’ve made with your team. 

You can mark tasks that are completed as done on this final action plan, 
bringing attention to how you’ve progressed toward the goal.

This will also bring out the tasks that are pending or delayed, in which case you need to figure out why and find suitable solutions. And then update the action plan accordingly.
