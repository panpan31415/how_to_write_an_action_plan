# What is an Action Plan?
- An action plan is a checklist for the steps or tasks
  you need to complete in order to achieve the goals you have set.

## Components of an action plan include
- A well-defined description of the goal to be achieved 
- Tasks/ steps that need to be carried out to reach the goal
- People who will be in charge of carrying out each task
- When will these tasks be completed (deadlines and milestones)
- Resources needed to complete the tasks
- Measures to evaluate progress 
  
>An action plan is not something set in stone. As your organization grows,
>and surrounding circumstances change, you will have to revisit and make
>adjustments to meet the latest needs.
